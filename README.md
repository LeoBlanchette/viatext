# VIATEXT 

The Alternate Internet: Offline-first. Mesh-ready. Designed like it’s 1986, deployed like it’s 2086.

This project utilizes LoRa modules and Arduino to create an alternate text-based internet.
It aims to be a simultaneous human/machine-agnostic text communication protocol — decentralized by design. It becomes a texting and email system that also runs a new form of IOT. 

Drawing inspiration from Fallout 4’s Railroad faction, this system prioritizes autonomy, privacy, and resilience. It leverages forgotten technologies — sourced from digital archives like archive.org — to construct a decentralized, text-based network beyond modern dependencies.
